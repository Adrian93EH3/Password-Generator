# Password-Generator
This was a very fun and difficult task. I'm sure I didn't tackle it correctly seeing as you all wanted prompts and alerts to be the way the User interacts with the password generator and selects their options for their password; but I honestly had some experience using labels and checkboxes before in the past with a project I created utilizing facts about animals. I brought some of that code over and used it here for the same concept and switched it all around to be based on password selection. Sorry if that's against the rules but I didn't want to try and re-invent the wheel as you all say. I knew I had some code laying around and I utitlized a Udemy video I had purchased and coded along with the instructor. I'm very honest >.<
